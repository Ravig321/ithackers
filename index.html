                    This is a student Hack Club, started by the team of IT Hacker's in SCRIET. The aim of starting it in
                    college was that in our college students still pay less attention in codings and programmings, more
                    in
                    completing degrees.
                    Our motto is that we can create an environment of Codings in our college. Due to which the skills of
                    our college students will also develop and they will go to college with their degree as well as some
                    new skills.<br><br>
                    Because so far, the students in our college think that they get a degree, and get a job after that.
                    We have thought of doing something new, so that our juniors do not have any problem, which we or
                    our seniors face, due to the lack of an environment of codings. Many kids have their skills buried
                    in them, so Our team has decided this, so that we and all of you will have no problem.
                    Someone has to start, so why don't we do it.<br><br>
                    Our Student Hack Club is also licensed by "US Newyork Hack Club", due to which students joining our
                    club have no problem in learning new things. Because we also have new workshops every week. A lot of
                    gifts and prizes are also coming from our New York Headquater for our Best Programmers of the week.
                    If you are from SCRIET then you can develop your skills by joining our club.<br><br>

                    For a better tomorrow, we need to leave the distinction of big and small and come together, because
                    our founder says, Team works makes dream works.<br><br>

                    It is a student community, a group started by some friends along with some classmates.

                    Where everyone thinks of doing something new together with each other, we also have fun, jokes and
                    study.
                    Our team has done more than 13 projects so far, which includes Android Development, Websites, and
                    many more.<br><br>

                    Our team is also running a Students Hack Club and a Foundation (Avika Foundation).
                    In which we are trying to promote codings in our college.
                    We also run a Dog Foundation, in which we provide food and first Aid to Stray Dogs. For this we do
                    not collect funds or money from anywhere, we all team members feed them with our pocket money.
                    Because who is there other than us?<br><br>

                    One of the aims of starting this student community was that on reading the need, we were able to
                    help our team mates, whether physically or economically.<br><br><br>
