                    Avika foundation is a dog care foundation which is operated by IT Hackers team. Our main aim to
                    operate this foundation only to save thousands life of stray dogs ,who are daily loosing their life
                    due to  an accident ,lack of food or by any other reasons.<br>
                    As we all know that,out of all animal present on earth the dogs are the most <b>loyal animal</b>. <br><br>
                    It's just not a content of dogs problem but it is to make you realise in what condition dogs are
                    living.Those dogs are dependent on human for their needs like shelter,food and rags during
                    winter etc.Just look around your society and try to show humanity to these helpless animals.
                    One day one of our founder saw a dog ,which  was at his last stage ,he was helpless and finally died
                    with his pain and problem.This incident shook (founder)from inside.Instantly he informed all of us
                    and induces us to take action for dogs .And finally we all established this foundation.
                    We know ,we can not save all lives but for few we can guaranteed.Our one step ahead could save many
                    life.<br><br>
                    Our team kindly request you all ,any type of your help for dog can bring joy and happiness in their
                    life,moreover it will maintain their community.You can help them by providing them you left over
                    food,yours rugs for them will be proven beneficial in many ways during winter or
                    By taking help of our volunteers you can also do financial help to our team by pressing <u>DONATE BUTTON.</u><br><br>
